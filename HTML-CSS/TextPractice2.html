    <dt> 1. Teriyaki Salmon 鮭の照り焼き</dt>
    <dd>This easy homemade Teriyaki Salmon are cooked in soy sauce, sake, and mirin.  If you buy salmon as a whole fish, you can fillet it the Japanese way. It helps to cook faster and absorb the flavors quickly. Not a seafood fan? Try Chicken Teriyaki or Beef Teriyaki.</dd>
    <dt>2. Stir Fry Vegetables 野菜炒め</dt>
    <dd>Loaded with plenty of vegetables and your choice of protein, this Stir fry Vegetables (Yasai Itame) makes a well-rounded weeknight meal. Not only everything comes together in less than 30 minutes, it’s also a great way to use up any leftovers.</dd>
    <dt>3. Omurice (Omelette Rice) オムライス</dt>
    <dd> A really popular Japanese Yoshoku (Japanese fusion) recipe, Omurice is one of my children’s favorite meals. The rice is pan-fried with ketchup and chicken, then wrapped in a thin layer of egg. When there is leftover rice, it’s a perfect single plate meal to prepare the next day.</dd>
